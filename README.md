# FizzBuzz Solution in C#

This repository contains a solution for the FizzBuzz challenge written in C#.

## Description

The FizzBuzz challenge is a common programming task, often used in interviews. The rules of the game are simple:

- For numbers 1 through 100,
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
- If the number is divisible by 3 (and not 5), print "Fizz".
- If the number is divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz".
- If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number itself.

## Implementation

The solution is implemented using a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 100. For each number, it checks if it's divisible by 3, 5, or both, and prints the appropriate output.

## Code

The code for the solution is in the `Program.cs` file.

## Usage

To run the solution, open the project in JetBrains Rider 2023.2.3 and run the `Program.cs` file.
